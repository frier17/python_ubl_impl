# UNIVERSAL BUSINESS LANGUAGE (UBL) PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION

This project is aimed at producing collections of business documents based on
 the [OASIS UBL 2.2 specification](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2
 .1/UBL-2.1.html)
 One of the goals of this project is to reduce development time in business
 applications requiring electronic documents as proof of business. The
 ideology adopted for developing this implementation is built off from the
 concept:
 "Every business service consist of activities performed at a cost and
requiring feedback (proof of transaction)."
This application is focused on generating proofs of transactions and not
business services, activities, or other such business component. Developers
can further extend this package to meet such needs or further improve the
existing proofs of transaction or business document.
