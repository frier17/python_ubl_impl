"""
The template module provides means for generating various business
documents. The Business Documents are based on the Universal Business
Language (UBL) XML schema definitions.
See: http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/UBL-2.1.html

The python implementation closely follows the the xml
class definition. It does not however, follow a one-to-one conversion of xml
schema to python classes. A lose mapping which allows for flexibility and
extension of the python implementation was adopted to enable developers use
the UBL standard across various scenarios without rigid boundaries.
This means, the python implementation is designed to allow for developers to
have wrapper classes which performs as Business Document (BusinessDocument) or
can be parsed into a printable documents. Achieving this is done by defining
the various Business Information Elements (BIE) as specified in UBL 2.1

Collection of classes in this module will include:
* BusinessDocumentTemplate
Utility classes private to this module will be used to generate various
types of Business documents such as Order, Invoice etc. dynamically from
specifying the named document type.
